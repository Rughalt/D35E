You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +20) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.\n</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\n</p><p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s caster level. If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\n</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\n</p><p><i>Area Dispel: </i>When <i>dispel magic </i>is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.\n</p><p>For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the <i>dispel magic </i>spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s magic items are not affected.\n</p><p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.\n</p><p>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the <i>dispel magic </i>spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.\n</p><p>For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the <i>dispel magic </i>spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\n</p><p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.\n</p><p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.\n</p><p><i>Counterspell: </i>When <i>dispel magic </i>is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic </i>may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell.\n</p><p>Additionally, <i>greater dispel magic </i>has a chance to dispel any effect that <i>remove curse </i>can remove, even if <i>dispel magic </i>can’t dispel that effect.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n","spellDuration":"Instantaneous","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"one spellcaster, creature, or object; or 20-ft.-radius burst","spellType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"showInQuickbar":false,"attack":{"parts":[]},"identifiedName":"Dispel Magic, Greater","isSpellSpontaneousReplacement":false,"conditionals":[],"changes":[],"combatChanges":[],"contextNotes":[],"specialActions":[],"activateActions":[],"deactivateActions":[],"container":"None","containerWeightless":false,"snip":"As dispel magic, but +20 on check."},"sort":600000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/spells/named-spells/dispel-magic-greater.png","effects":[]}

It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction.

You must overcome a creature’s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i>protection from law</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies’ spell resistance.\n</p><p>This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against law </i>can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nonchaotic called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding, planar binding, </i>and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle’s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell’s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from law </i>spell for that creature only.\n</p><p>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, </i>and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature’s extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor </i>effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle </i>does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle, </i>but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\n</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle </i>more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\n</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on the <i>magic circle </i>during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor </i>holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle </i>for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle </i>prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding </i>spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.\n</p><p>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from law </i>and vice versa.\n</p><p><i>Arcane Material Component: </i>A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n</div>\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"touch","long":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","autoDeductCharges":true},"measureTemplate":{"type":"circle","size":0,"overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"actionType":"other","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","display":"","isPower":false,"ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","description":"Will negates (harmless)"},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","learnedAt":{"class":[["Cleric",3],["Wizard",3],["Sorcerer",3]],"domain":[["Chaos",3]],"subDomain":[],"elementalSchool":[],"bloodline":[]},"level":3,"clOffset":0,"slOffset":0,"school":"abj","subschool":"","types":"chaotic","components":{"value":"","verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"focus":true,"divineFocus":2},"castTime":"","materials":{"value":"a little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded","consumed":{"value":false,"_deprecated":true},"focus":""},"spellbook":"primary","preparation":{"preparedAmount":0,"maxAmount":0,"autoDeductCharges":true,"mode":"prepared"},"atWill":false,"powerPointsCost":0,"sr":false,"pr":false,"shortDescription":"\n\n\n<p>\nAll creatures within the area gain the effects of a <i>protection from law </i>spell, and no nonchaotic summoned creatures can enter the area either.

A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, </i>and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature’s extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor </i>effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle </i>does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle, </i>but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\n</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle </i>more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\n</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on the <i>magic circle </i>during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor </i>holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle </i>for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle </i>prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding </i>spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.\n</p><p>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from law </i>and vice versa.\n</p><p><i>Arcane Material Component: </i>A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n","spellDuration":"10 min./level","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","spellType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"showInQuickbar":false,"attack":{"parts":[]},"identifiedName":"Magic Circle against Law","isSpellSpontaneousReplacement":false,"conditionals":[],"changes":[],"combatChanges":[],"contextNotes":[],"specialActions":[],"activateActions":[],"deactivateActions":[],"container":"None","containerWeightless":false,"snip":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","uniqueId":"","resistances":[],"damageReduction":[]},"sort":600000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/spells/named-spells/magic-circle-against-law.png","effects":[]}

This swarm forms a living aura around the character to a radius of 10 feet. The character is immune to his or her own <i>crown of vermin</i>. The swarm goes where the character goes at his or her speed, even if the character takes to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the <i>crown of vermin</i> bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or the character forces the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for 1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who fall prey to the <i>crown of vermi</i>n. The vermin have damage reduction 1/epic, so the vermin’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If there aren’t enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell’s effect, the creature with the fewest hit points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit points, and so on. After all creatures that can be killed have been killed, any remaining damage is distributed among the survivors equally.\n</p><p>The character has utter control over the vermin in his or her aura, and can force them into areas that would normally deter common vermin. The character can completely suppress his or her vermin aura as a free action so that no vermin are visible at all. The time that vermin are suppressed does not count toward the spell’s duration. Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and move the vermin in any fashion he or she desires within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a move-equivalent action.

This swarm forms a living aura around the character to a radius of 10 feet. The character is immune to his or her own <i>crown of vermin</i>. The swarm goes where the character goes at his or her speed, even if the character takes to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the <i>crown of vermin</i> bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or the character forces the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for 1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who fall prey to the <i>crown of vermi</i>n. The vermin have damage reduction 1/epic, so the vermin’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If there aren’t enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell’s effect, the creature with the fewest hit points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit points, and so on. After all creatures that can be killed have been killed, any remaining damage is distributed among the survivors equally.\n</p><p>The character has utter control over the vermin in his or her aura, and can force them into areas that would normally deter common vermin. The character can completely suppress his or her vermin aura as a free action so that no vermin are visible at all. The time that vermin are suppressed does not count toward the spell’s duration. Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and move the vermin in any fashion he or she desires within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a move-equivalent action.

Creatures moving through the <i>gate </i>from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.\n</p><p><i>Planar Travel:</i> As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate</i> spell functions much like a <i>plane shift</i> spell, except that the <i>gate </i>opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a <i>gate</i> from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire.

A <i>gate</i> cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.\n</p><p>You may hold the <i>gate </i>open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.\n</p><p><i>Calling Creatures: </i>The second effect of the <i>gate</i> spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate</i> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate, </i>although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate</i> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).\n</p><p>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.\n</p><p>A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature’s help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.\n</p><p>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <i>lesser planar ally</i> spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.\n</p><p>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least.

You can’t create a simulacrum of a creature whose Hit Dice or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is.

You look as though you’re winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.\n</p><p><i>Blinking </i>has several effects, as follows.\n</p><p>Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn’t help opponents, since you’re ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).\n</p><p>If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.\n</p><p>Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you’re <i>blinking </i>unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.\n</p><p>While <i>blinking</i>, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.\n</p><p>You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.\n</p><p>While <i>blinking</i>, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)\n</p><p>Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.\n</p><p>An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.\n</p><p>An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.\n</p><p>Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa.

When triggered, a <i>symbol of death </i>slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death </i>affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol </i>becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points’ worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death </i>is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol </i>only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol </i>is still active, it must save again.\n</p><p>Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death </i>is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death </i>must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death </i>ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death </i>works normally.\n</p><p>As a default, a <i>symbol of death </i>is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>’s triggering conditions cannot be changed.\n</p><p>In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death </i>to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can’t use a <i>symbol of death </i>offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death </i>is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death </i>cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\n</p><p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of death </i>can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify.\n</p><p>When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect<i>. </i>Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\n</p><p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death, </i>but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death </i>cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\n</p><p><i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol of death </i>with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.

When triggered, a <i>symbol of death </i>slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death </i>affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol </i>becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points’ worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death </i>is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol </i>only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol </i>is still active, it must save again.\n</p><p>Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death </i>is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death </i>must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death </i>ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death </i>works normally.\n</p><p>As a default, a <i>symbol of death </i>is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>’s triggering conditions cannot be changed.\n</p><p>In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death </i>to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can’t use a <i>symbol of death </i>offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death </i>is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death </i>cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\n</p><p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of death </i>can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify.\n</p><p>When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect<i>. </i>Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\n</p><p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death, </i>but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death </i>cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\n</p><p><i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol of death </i>with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the <i>symbol of death </i>is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\n</p><p>A <i>symbol of death </i>can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic </i>targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death. </i>Destruction of the surface where a <i>symbol of death </i>is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol </i>but also triggers it.\n</p><p><i>Symbol of death </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.

All <i>binding </i>spells are dismissible.\n</p><p>Regardless of the version of <i>binding </i>you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.

The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding </i>is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.\n</p><p><i>Slumber: </i>This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while <i>slumbering</i>, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding </i>is more difficult to cast than <i>chaining</i>, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell’s save DC by 1.\n</p><p><i>Bound Slumber: </i>This combination of <i>chaining </i>and <i>slumber </i>lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.\n</p><p><i>Hedged Prison: </i>The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.\n</p><p><i>Metamorphosis: </i>The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding </i>is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <i>metamorphosed</i>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\n</p><p><i>Minimus Containment: </i>The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object.

The character’s consciousness and physical form are suppressed for the duration of the possession. The character has no way to dismiss the spell, communicate, or otherwise maintain awareness once possession has commenced. The dream larva, temporarily freed from its imprisonment in some distant nightmare, will attempt to slay and incapacitate any creature it can see or find, whether it is a friend or foe of the caster. Casting <i>lord of nightmares</i> entails some risk for the caster, since it’s unknown what a dream larva might do over the course of 20 rounds. The larva will dispatch all enemies it can find before turning to its own concerns. Sometimes a dream larva will attempt to place itself in a dangerous or precarious situation prior to the end of the spell, leaving the caster to extricate him or herself. If the dream larva is slain during the duration of the spell, the character’s consciousness is instantly restored to awareness within his or her own body. The character’s condition remains what it was when he or she completed casting <i>lord of nightmare</i>s, regardless of what damage the dream larva received. However, magic item charges used, potions consumed, and other physical resources used up by the dream larva are permanent.\n</p><p><i>XP Cost:</i> 1,000 XP.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n","spellDuration":"20 rounds\n","spellEffect":"One summoned creature\n","spellArea":"","spellType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"showInQuickbar":false,"attack":{"parts":[]},"identifiedName":"Lord of Nightmares"},"sort":600000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/spells/school/con_.png","effects":[]}

A <i>wall of ice </i>cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a <i>wall of ice, </i>and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a <i>wall of ice </i>creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.\n</p><p><i>Ice Plane: </i>A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.\n</p><p>Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.\n</p><p>Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).\n</p><p><i>Hemisphere: </i>The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level.

Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a <i>wall of ice, </i>and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a <i>wall of ice </i>creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.\n</p><p><i>Ice Plane: </i>A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.\n</p><p>Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.\n</p><p>Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).\n</p><p><i>Hemisphere: </i>The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The <i>hemisphere </i>is as hard to break through as the <i>ice plane </i>form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.\n</p><p><i>Material Component: </i>A small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n","spellDuration":"1 min./level\n","spellEffect":"Anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level, or hemisphere of ice with a radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level\n","spellArea":"","spellType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"showInQuickbar":false,"attack":{"parts":[]},"identifiedName":"Wall of Ice","snip":"Ice plane creates wall with 15 hp +1/level, or hemisphere can trap creatures inside."},"sort":600000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/spells/named-spells/wall-of-ice.png","effects":[]}

A <i>magic circle against evil </i>can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding, planar binding, </i>and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>.

If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, </i>and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature’s extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor </i>effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle </i>does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle, </i>but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\n</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle </i>more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective.

You must overcome a creature’s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i>protection from chaos</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies’ spell resistance.\n</p><p>This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against chaos </i>can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nonlawful called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding, planar binding, </i>and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle’s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell’s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from chaos </i>spell for that creature only.\n</p><p>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, </i>and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature’s extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor </i>effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle </i>does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle, </i>but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\n</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle </i>more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\n</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on the <i>magic circle </i>during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor </i>holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle </i>for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle </i>prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram.

You must overcome a creature’s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i>protection from chaos</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies’ spell resistance.\n</p><p>This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against chaos </i>can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nonlawful called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding, planar binding, </i>and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle’s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell’s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from chaos </i>spell for that creature only.\n</p><p>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, </i>and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature’s extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor </i>effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle </i>does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle, </i>but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\n</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle </i>more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\n</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on the <i>magic circle </i>during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor </i>holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle </i>for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle </i>prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding </i>spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it.
