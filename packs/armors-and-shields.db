A heavy steel shield is so heavy that you can’t use your shield hand for anything else. Whether wooden or steel, a heavy shield offers the same basic protection and attack benefits, though the two versions respond differently to some spells and effects (such as&nbsp;rusting grasp). A druid can use a heavy wooden shield, but not a heavy steel shield.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"quantity":1,"weight":10,"price":7,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":15,"value":15},"hardness":5,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"equipped":true,"equipmentType":"shield","equipmentSubtype":"heavyShield","armor":{"value":2,"dex":null,"acp":2,"enh":0},"armorType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"spellFailure":15,"slot":"shield","activation":{"cost":null,"type":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","_id":"ioCsEZc3Shc3t4Sv"}

In most situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to your AC. As a standard action, however, you can use a tower shield to grant you total cover until the beginning of your next turn.
