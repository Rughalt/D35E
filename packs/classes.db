Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting</h2>\n<p>A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally\">summon nature’s ally</a>&nbsp;spell of the same level or lower.</p>\n<h2>Chaotic, Evil, Good and Lawful Spells</h2>\n<p>A druid can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Orisons (Sp)</h2>\n<p>Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Druid&nbsp;under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A druid’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>\n<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>\n<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>\n<h2>Nature Bond (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/air-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Air</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/animal-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Animal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/earth-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/fire-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fire</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/plant-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plant</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/water-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Water</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/weather-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weather</a>. Druids also have access to a set of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/archetypes/paizo-druid-archetypes/animal-and-terrain-domains\">Animal and Terrain Domains</a>. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid’s effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Animal-Choices\">Animal Choices</a>. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>\n<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion’s Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>\n<h2>Nature Sense (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A druid gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(nature) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;checks.</p>\n<h2>Wild Empathy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>. This ability functions just like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.</p>\n<p>The typical domestic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>&nbsp;are usually unfriendly.</p>\n<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>\n<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.</p>\n<h2>Woodland Stride (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>\n<h2>Trackless Step (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>\n<h2>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that target plants, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight\">blight</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/entangle\">entangle</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spike-growth\">spike growth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/warp-wood\">warp wood</a>.</p>\n<h2>Wild Shape (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small or Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;type. This ability functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape I</a>&nbsp;spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p>\n<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>\n<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains in levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elementals</a>, and plants. Each form expends one daily usage of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;or a Small&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>, a druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape II</a>. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body I</a>.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>, a Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape III</a>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body II</a>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid’s wild shape functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i\">plant shape I</a>.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>&nbsp;or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body III</a>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i\">plant shape II</a>.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>&nbsp;or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body IV</a>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i\">plant shape III</a>.</p>\n<h2>Venom Immunity (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>\n<h2>A Thousand Faces (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/alter-self\">alter self</a>&nbsp;spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>\n<h2>Timeless Body (Ex)</h2>\n<p>After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"kowljhpAAAuoOaJG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.D35E.classes.49GnJA0FkMKKYKqQ"}}}

While mages and sorcerers draw their might from the arcane structure of the world by complex incantations and clerics ask gods for powers, those whose minds are above others bend reality just by pure power of their thoughts.

She also counts as both a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monk</a>&nbsp;for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/stunning-fist-combat\">Stunning Fist</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/robe-monk-s\">monk’s robe</a>). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighters</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monks</a>&nbsp;based on class level, namely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/stunning-fist-combat\">Stunning Fist</a>.</p>\n<h2>Unarmed Strike</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a brawler gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-unarmed-strike-combat\">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;modifier (not half ) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p>\n<p>Usually, a brawler’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;instead with no penalty on her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. She has the same choice to deal lethal or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grappling</a>.</p>\n<p>A brawler’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapon</a>&nbsp;for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapons</a>.</p>\n<p>A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on&nbsp;Table: Brawler. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 10px; table-layout: fixed; border-color: #888888; min-width: 200px; color: #333333; font-family: Varela, sans-serif;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 10px 0px; color: black; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;\">Table: Small or Large Brawler Unarmed Damage</caption>\n<thead style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #cfe2f3;\">\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Level</th>\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Small Brawler</th>\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Large Brawler</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1st-3rd</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d4</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #f3f3f3;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">4th-7th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d6</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">8th-11th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d8</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #f3f3f3;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">12th-15th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d10</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">16th-19th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d6</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">3d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #f3f3f3;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">20th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d8</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">4d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Bonus Combat Feats</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;in place of a bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;for the level.</p>\n<h2>Brawler's Flurry (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler’s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;weapon group, or weapons with the “<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monk</a>” special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>\n<p>A brawler applies her full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler’s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm\">disarm</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip\">trip</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuvers</a>&nbsp;for unarmed attacks as part of brawler’s flurry. A brawler with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapons</a>&nbsp;can’t use such weapons as part of brawler’s flurry, nor can she make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapon</a>&nbsp;attacks in addition to her brawler’s flurry attacks.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Improved Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when using brawler’s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/greater-two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when using brawler’s flurry.</p>\n<h2>Maneuver Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;checks when performing that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;and a +1 bonus to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>&nbsp;when defending against that maneuver.</p>\n<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>, gaining the above +1 bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;checks and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Maneuver-Training-Ex-\">maneuver training</a>&nbsp;increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;at 3rd level and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;at 7th level, her bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;are +2 and bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;are +1. If she then chooses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush\">bull rush</a>&nbsp;upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;are +3, to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;are +2, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush\">bull rush</a>&nbsp;are +1.)</p>\n<h2>AC Bonus (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, she gains a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to AC and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<p>These bonuses to AC apply against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>, wearing medium or heavy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>\n<h2>Knockout (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>. She must announce this intent before making her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler’s level + the higher of the brawler’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier) or fall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>&nbsp;that does not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. Creatures immune to critical hits or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>\n<h2>Brawler's Strike (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a brawler’s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold\">cold iron</a>&nbsp;and silver for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. At 12th level, she chooses one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. (This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;component cannot be the opposite of the brawler’s actual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a>&nbsp;weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;and bypassing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness\">hardness</a>.</p>\n<h2>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a brawler’s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/dagger\">dagger</a>&nbsp;deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon’s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of her adjusted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;damage—this must be declared before the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;is made.</p>\n<h2>Awesome Blow (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, the brawler can as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;perform an awesome blow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler’s choice, and it falls&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can’t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent’s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>&nbsp;in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/awesome-blow\">Awesome Blow</a>&nbsp;monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>\n<h2>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>.

Never knowing what to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any of dozens of other professions or talents.

She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good night’s sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Spellbooks</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for&nbsp;<em>read magic</em>, which all wizards can prepare from memory.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any; see School Specialization, below) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to her own.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">School Specialization</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme. If desired, a wizard may specialize in one school of magic (see below). Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but she then never learns to cast spells from some other schools.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty at 1st level. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination; see below), which become her prohibited schools.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A wizard can never give up divination to fulfill this requirement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the wizard, and she can’t even cast such spells from scrolls or fire them from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her prohibited schools later.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal spells.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Abjuration:&nbsp;</em>Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration specialist is called an abjurer.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Conjuration:&nbsp;</em>Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A conjuration specialist is called a conjurer.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Divination:&nbsp;</em>Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is called a diviner. Unlike the other specialists, a diviner must give up only one other school.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Enchantment:&nbsp;</em>Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Evocation:&nbsp;</em>Spells that manipulate energy or create something from nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Illusion:&nbsp;</em>Spells that alter perception or create false images. An illusion specialist is called an illusionist.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Necromancy:&nbsp;</em>Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life force. A necromancy specialist is called a necromancer.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Transmutation:&nbsp;</em>Spells that transform the recipient physically or change its properties in a more subtle way. A transmutation specialist is called a transmuter.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Universal:&nbsp;</em>Not a school, but a category for spells that all wizards can learn. A wizard cannot select universal as a specialty school or as a prohibited school.

At each new inquisitor level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Inquisitor Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an inquisitor knows is not affected by her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score. The numbers on&nbsp;Table: Inquisitor Spells Known&nbsp;are fixed.)</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the inquisitor “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast. The inquisitor may swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>, an inquisitor must still hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact she can go against them if it serves the greater good of the faith. An inquisitor can select one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain. With the GM’s approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an inquisitor. Levels of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;and inquisitor stack for the purpose of determining domain powers and abilities, but not for bonus spells.</p>\n<p>A complete listing of domains can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">Domains</a>. Inquisitors also have access to Inquisitions, which are similar to Domains but do not include Domain spells. A complete listing of Inquisitions can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor/inquisitions\">Inquisitions</a>.</p>\n<h2>Judgement (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, an inquisitor can pronounce judgment upon her foes as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses.

As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil\">evil</a>, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules\">Neutral</a>&nbsp;inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<div>\n<p><a name=\"judgment-destruction\"></a><strong>Destruction</strong>: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Sacred-Bonus\">sacred bonus</a>&nbsp;on all weapon damage rolls.

The inquisitor’s weapons count as magic for the purposes of bypassing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>.

The type selected must match one of the inquisitor’s alignments. If the inquisitor is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules\">neutral</a>, she does not receive this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor’s weapons also count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;(but not for reducing hardness).</p>\n<h2>Monster Lore (Ex)</h2>\n<p>The inquisitor adds her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill checks in addition to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.</p>\n<h2>Orisons</h2>\n<p>Inquisitors learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Inquisitor Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Orisons prepared using other spell slots, such as those due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats#TOC-Metamagic-Feats\">metamagic</a>&nbsp;feats, are expended normally.</p>\n<h2>Stern Gaze (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Inquisitors are skilled at sensing deception and intimidating their foes. An inquisitor receives a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus\">morale bonus</a>&nbsp;on all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive\">Sense Motive</a>&nbsp;checks equal to 1/2 her inquisitor level (minimum +1).</p>\n<h2>Cunning Initiative (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;checks, in addition to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<h2>Detect Alignment (Sp)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, at will, an inquisitor can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-chaos\">detect chaos</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil\">detect evil</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-good\">detect good</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-law\">detect law</a>. She can only use one of these at any given time.</p>\n<h2>Track (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds half her level on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>\n<h2>Solo Tactics (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, all of the inquisitor’s allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feats as the inquisitor for the purpose of determining whether the inquisitor receives a bonus from her teamwork feats. Her allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves. The allies’ positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the inquisitor to receive the listed bonus.</p>\n<h2>Teamwork Feat</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feats</a>. The inquisitor must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.</p>\n<p>As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the inquisitor can choose to learn a new bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;in place of the most recent bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;she has already learned. In effect, the inquisitor loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can only change the most recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;gained. Whenever she gains a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>, the previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;becomes set and cannot be changed again. An inquisitor can change her most recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;a number of times per day equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<h2>Bane (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, an inquisitor can imbue one of her weapons with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/bane/\">bane weapon special ability</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. She must select one creature type when she uses this ability (and a subtype if the creature type selected is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoid</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsider</a>). Once selected, the type can be changed as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. This ability only functions while the inquisitor wields the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon resumes granting this ability if it is returned to the inquisitor before the duration expires. This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the inquisitor’s level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>\n<h2>Discern Lies (Sp)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, an inquisitor can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/discern-lies\">discern lies</a>, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action.</p>\n<h2>Second Judgement (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she selects two different judgments, instead of one. This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, she can change one of these judgments to another type.</p>\n<h2>Stalwart (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, an inquisitor can use mental and physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If she makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can only be used if the inquisitor is wearing light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or no armor. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;inquisitor does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.</p>\n<h2>Greater Bane (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 12th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her bane ability, the amount of bonus damage dealt by the weapon against creatures of the selected type increases to 4d6.</p>\n<h2>Exploit Weakness (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, the inquisitor learns to take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself. Whenever the inquisitor scores a critical hit, she ignores any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;the target might have. In addition, if the target has regeneration, the creature loses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-\">regeneration</a>&nbsp;on the round following the critical hit and can die normally during that round. Creatures whose&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-\">regeneration</a>&nbsp;always functions are immune to this ability.

This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, the inquisitor can change one of these judgments to another type.</p>\n<h2>Slayer (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, an inquisitor learns to focus her judgment. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she must select one type of judgment. She is treated as if she were 5 levels higher for the purposes of determining the bonus granted by this judgment. Unlike other types of judgment, the one enhanced by this ability cannot be changed for the remainder of the judgment.</p>\n<h2>True Judgement (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, an inquisitor can call true judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, the inquisitor can invoke true judgment on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the inquisitor can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor’s level + the inquisitor’s Wisdom modifier. Regardless of whether or not the save is made, the target creature is immune to the inquisitor’s true judgment ability for 24 hours. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"kowljhpAAAuoOaJG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.D35E.classes.VwVlbNYqDgMBIWhQ"}}}

Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any nonlawful.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6.</p>\n<h2>Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The bard’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak Language (n/a), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level: </strong>(6 + Int modifier) x4.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level: </strong>6 + Int modifier.</p>\n<h2>Ex-Bards</h2>\n<p>A bard who becomes lawful in alignment cannot progress in levels as a bard, though he retains all his bard abilities.</p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 13px; opacity: 0.8;\">Some description after&nbsp; Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. © 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.

He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard’s Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p>\n<p>The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance.

Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself ) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard’s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s Perform check result for the save.

Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.</p> <p>To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature&rsquo;s Will save against the effect. If a creature&rsquo;s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a &ndash;4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.</p> <p>Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.</p>"],[1,"Inspire Courage","A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself ), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th).

A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard&rsquo;s level + bard&rsquo;s Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below).

For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target’s Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability."],[12,"Song of Freedom","A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the break enchantment spell (caster level equals the character’s bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can’t use song of freedom on himself."],[15,"Inspire Heroics","A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability."],[18,"Mass Suggestion","This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated (see above).

A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened\">deaf</a>&nbsp;bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.</p>\n<p>If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded\">blind</a>&nbsp;bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component.

Each round of the countersong he makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;(keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;skill check result for the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.</p>\n<p><a id=\"TOC-Distraction-Su-\"></a><strong>Distraction (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of the Distraction, he makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;(act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion\">illusion</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-lllusion-Pattern\">pattern</a>) or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion\">illusion</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-lllusion-Figment\">figment</a>) magical attack may use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result proves to be higher.

Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The Distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability.</p>\n<p>Each creature within range receives a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Cha</a>&nbsp;modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it. While&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated\">fascinated</a>, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>&nbsp;checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.</p>\n<p>Fascinate is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment\">enchantment</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion\">compulsion</a>), mind-affecting ability.

In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline. As reward for their righteousness, these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the faithful.

This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).  Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin’s level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a particular mount from service.  Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect.  Should the paladin’s mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls."],[0,"Code of Conduct","A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act.  Additionally, a paladin’s code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents."],[0,"Associates","While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good."]],"extraDescription":{"value":"<h2>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>A warpriest is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as the favored weapon of his deity, and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (except tower shields). If the warpriest worships a deity with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;as its favored weapon, the warpriest gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-unarmed-strike-combat\">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2>Spell Casting (Divine)</h2>\n<p>A warpriest casts divine spells drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-cleric\">cleric spell list</a>. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>, however, can restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see the Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells section. A warpriest must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>\n<p>A warpriest’s highest level of spells is 6th. Cleric spells of 7th level and above are not on the warpriest class spell list, and a warpriest cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device\">Use Magic Device</a>&nbsp;check) of cleric spells of 7th level or higher.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a warpriest must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The saving throw DC against a warpriest’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the warpriest’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a warpriest can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table Warpriest. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he had a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score.</p>\n<p>Warpriests meditate or pray for their spells. Each warpriest must choose a time when he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. A warpriest can prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Orisons</strong>: Warpriests can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on&nbsp;Table Warpriest. These spells are cast as any other spell, but aren’t expended when cast and can be used again.</p>\n<p><strong>Spontaneous Casting</strong>: A good warpriest (or a neutral warpriest of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing\">healing</a>&nbsp;spells that he did not prepare ahead of time. The warpriest can expend any prepared spell that isn’t an orison to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower. A cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name.</p>\n<p>An evil warpriest (or a neutral warpriest of an evil deity) can’t convert spells to cure spells, but can convert them to inflict spells. An inflict spell is any spell with “inflict” in its name.</p>\n<p>A warpriest that is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil chooses whether he can convert spells into either cure spells or inflict spells. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. This choice also determines whether the warpriest channels positive or negative energy (see Channel Energy, below).</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</strong>: A warpriest cannot cast spells of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;opposed to his own or his deity’s (if he has a deity). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Aura (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A warpriest of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura (as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>) corresponding to the deity’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil\">detect evil</a>).</p>\n<h2>Blessings (Su)</h2>\n<p>A warpriest’s deity influences his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. Each warpriest can select two blessings from among those granted by his deity (each deity grants the blessings tied to its domains). A warpriest can select an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;blessing (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;matches that domain. If a warpriest isn’t devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM approval. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>\n<p>Each blessing grants a minor power at 1st level and a major power at 10th level. A warpriest can call upon the power of his blessings a number of times per day (in any combination) equal to 3 + 1/2 his warpriest level (to a maximum of 13 times per day at 20th level). Each time he calls upon any one of his blessings, it counts against his daily limit. The save DC for these blessings is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warpriest’s level + the warpriest’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>If a warpriest also has levels in a class that grants&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;domains, the blessings chosen must match the domains selected by that class. Subject to GM discretion, the warpriest can change his former blessings or domains to make them conform.<br><br>Blessings are here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/warpriest/blessings/\">Blessings.</a></p>\n<h2>Focus Weapon</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a warpriest receives&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat (he can choose any weapon, not just his deity’s favored weapon).</p>\n<h2>Sacred Weapon (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, weapons wielded by a warpriest are charged with the power of his faith. In addition to the favored weapon of his deity, the warpriest can designate a weapon as a sacred weapon by selecting that weapon with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;feat; if he has multiple&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;feats, this ability applies to all of them. Whenever the warpriest hits with his sacred weapon, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type. The damage for Medium warpriests is listed on Table 1–14; see the table below for Small and Large warpriests. The warpriest can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of the sacred weapon damage—this must be declared before the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;is made. (If the weapon’s base damage exceeds the sacred weapon damage, its damage is unchanged.) This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon, and doesn’t apply to alchemical items, bombs, or other weapons that only deal energy damage.</p>\n<p>At 4th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance one of his sacred weapons with divine power as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. This power grants the weapon a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>. For every 4 levels beyond 4th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). If the warpriest has more than one sacred weapon, he can enhance another on the following round by using another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. The warpriest can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his warpriest level, but these rounds need not be consecutive.</p>\n<p>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance a weapon with any of the following weapon special abilities:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/brilliant-energy\">brilliant energy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/defending\">defending</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/disruption\">disruption</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/frost\">frost</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/keen\">keen</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shock\">shock</a>. In addition, if the warpriest is chaotic, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/anarchic\">anarchic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/vicious\">vicious</a>. If he is evil, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/mighty-cleaving\">mighty cleaving</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy\">unholy</a>. If he is good, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/ghost-touch\">ghost touch</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/holy\">holy</a>. If he is lawful, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/axiomatic\">axiomatic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/merciful\">merciful</a>. If he is neutral (with no other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>), he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/spell-storing\">spell storing</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/thundering\">thundering</a>. Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability’s base cost. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The weapon must have at least a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;before any other special abilities can be added.</p>\n<p>If multiple weapons are enhanced, each one consumes rounds of use individually. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;and special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the next day. These bonuses do not apply if another creature is wielding the weapon, but they continue to be in effect if the weapon otherwise leaves the warpriest’s possession (such as if the weapon is thrown). This ability can be ended as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;at the start of the warpriest’s turn (that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed during the same round). If the warpriest uses this ability on a double weapon, the effects apply to only one end of the weapon.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 10px; table-layout: fixed; border-color: #888888; min-width: 200px; color: #333333; font-family: Varela, sans-serif;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #cfe2f3;\">\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Level</th>\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Damage(Small)</th>\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Damage(Large)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1st-4rd</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d4</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #f3f3f3;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">5th-9th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d6</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">10th-14th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d8</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #f3f3f3;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">15th-19th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d10</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">20th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d6</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">3d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A warpriest’s bonus language options include Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal.

Using fervor in this way is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that provokes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">Undead</a>&nbsp;do not receive a saving throw against this damage. This counts as positive energy.</p>\n<p>An evil warpriest (or one who worships an evil deity) can use this ability to instead deal damage to living creatures with a melee&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch attack</a>&nbsp;and heal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures with a touch. This counts as negative energy.</p>\n<p>A neutral warpriest who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) uses this ability as a good warpriest if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells or as an evil warpriest if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict spells.</p>\n<p>As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, a warpriest can expend one use of this ability to cast any one warpriest spell he has prepared with a casting time of 1 round or shorter. When cast in this way, the spell can target only the warpriest, even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets. Spells cast in this way ignore somatic components and do not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. The warpriest does not need to have a free hand to cast a spell in this way.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feats</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a warpriest gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feats</a>. The warpriest must meet the prerequisites for these feats, but he treats his warpriest level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;(in addition to base attack bonuses gained from other classes and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-\">Hit Dice</a>) for the purpose of qualifying for these feats.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the purposes of these feats, the warpriest can select feats that have a minimum number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;levels as a prerequisite, treating his warpriest level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;level.</p>\n<h2>Channel Energy (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a warpriest can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of his faith through his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/holy\">holy</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy\">unholy</a>) symbol. This energy can be used to deal or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted. Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that expends two uses of his fervor ability and doesn’t provoke an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>. The warpriest must present a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/holy\">holy</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy\">unholy</a>) symbol to use this ability. A good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to heal living creatures or to deal damage to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures. An evil warpriest (or one who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or heal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures. A neutral warpriest who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) channels positive energy if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells or negative energy if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict spells.</p>\n<p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the warpriest. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to the amount listed in the fervor ability. Creatures that take damage from channeled energy must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saving throw to halve the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 the warpriest’s level + the warpriest’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier. Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing\">healing</a>&nbsp;is lost. A warpriest can choose whether or not to include himself in this effect.</p>\n<h2>Sacred Armor (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance his armor with divine power as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. This power grants the armor a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>. For every 3 levels beyond 7th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). The warpriest can use this ability a number of minutes per day equal to his warpriest level. This duration must be used in 1-minute increments, but they don’t need to be consecutive.</p>\n<p>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the armor might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance armor any of the following armor special abilities: energy resistance (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/energy-resistance/\">normal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/energy-resistance-improved/\">improved</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/energy-resistance-greater/\">greater</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/fortification/\">fortification</a>&nbsp;(heavy, light, or moderate),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/glamered\">glamered</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/spell-resistance/\">spell resistance</a>&nbsp;(13, 15, 17, and 19). Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability’s base cost. For this purpose, glamered counts as a +1 bonus, energy resistance counts as +2, improved energy resistance counts as +4, and greater energy resistance counts as +5. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The armor must have at least a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;before any other special abilities can be added.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;and armor special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the next day. These bonuses apply only while the warpriest is wearing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and end immediately if the armor is removed or leaves the warpriest’s possession. This ability can be ended as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;at the start of the warpriest’s turn. This ability cannot be applied to a shield.</p>\n<p>When the warpriest uses this ability, he can also use his sacred weapon ability as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;by expending one use of his fervor.</p>\n<h2>Aspect of War (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the warpriest can channel an aspect of war, growing in power and martial ability. Once per day as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, a warpriest can treat his level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>, gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;10/—, and can move at his full speed regardless of the armor he is wearing or his encumbrance. In addition, the blessings he calls upon don’t count against his daily limit during this time. This ability lasts for 1 minute.</p>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"specialActions":[],"activateActions":[],"deactivateActions":[],"perRoundActions":[],"container":"None","containerWeightless":false,"identifiedName":"Paladin"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"kowljhpAAAuoOaJG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.D35E.classes.i8FlSB5c6b5TlXHc"}}}

Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption.

However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric’s Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).</p>\n<p>Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>\n<p>Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells: A cleric’s deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to his deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.</p>\n<p>If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>\n<p>Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.</p>\n<p>With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.</p>\n<p>Spontaneous Casting: A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can’t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its name).</p>\n<p>A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player’s choice).

Her alignment, however, may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells.

This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.</p>\n<p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous casting).</p>\n<p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\" rel=\"nofollow\">Will</a>&nbsp;save to halve the damage.

A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.</p>\n<p>A cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability.</p>\n<h2>Domains</h2>\n<p>A cleric’s deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domains</a>&nbsp;from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an alignment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;(Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>. If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, she still selects two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domains</a>&nbsp;to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities (subject to GM approval). The restriction on alignment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domains</a>&nbsp;still applies.</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;grants a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;powers, dependent upon the level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>s in that slot. If a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.</p>\n<p>In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise noted, activating a domain power is a standard action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete listing of cleric domains can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">Cleric Domains</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting</h2>\n<p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).</p>\n<p>An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity) can’t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its name).</p>\n<p>A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player’s choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed.

These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">Combat Feats</a>, sometimes also called “fighter bonus feats.”</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bravery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Armor Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus allowed.</p>\n<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Armor Training</strong>: Beginning at 7th level, instead of increasing the benefits provided by armor training (reducing his armor’s check penalty by 1 and increasing its maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus by 1), a fighter can choose an advanced armor training option (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Fighter/#Advanced-Armor-Training\">Advanced Armor Training</a>&nbsp;below) . If the fighter does so, he still gains the ability to move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor at 3rd level, and while wearing heavy armor at 7th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weapon Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th*, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>\n<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from his group. This bonus also applies to the fighter’s Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Weapon Training</strong>: Beginning at 9th level, instead of selecting an additional fighter weapon group, a fighter can choose an advanced weapon training option (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Fighter/#Advanced-Weapon-Training\">Advanced Weapon Training</a>&nbsp;below) for one fighter weapon group that he previously selected with the

gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;5/— whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Advanced Armor Training</h2>\n<p>Highly skilled and tenacious fighters can gain advanced armor training, learning techniques and applications of the armor training class feature that give them special benefits in exchange for reducing their ability to mitigate their armor’s armor check penalty and improve its maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus.</p>\n<p>Advanced armor training options function only when the fighter is wearing appropriate armor or using a shield, unless otherwise noted. A fighter with an archetype that replaces armor training cannot select advanced armor training options.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Adaptable Training (Ex)</strong>: The fighter can use his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;in place of his ranks in one skill of his choice from the following list:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb\">Climb</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise\">Disguise</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist\">Escape Artist</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(engineering),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a>&nbsp;(soldier),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride\">Ride</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim\">Swim</a>. The fighter need not be wearing armor or using a shield to use this option. When using adaptable training, the fighter substitutes his total&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;(including his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in this skill, but adds the skill’s usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Once a skill has been selected, it cannot be changed and the fighter can immediately retrain all of his ranks in the selected skill at no additional cost in money or time. In addition, the fighter adds all skills chosen with this option to his list of class skills. A fighter can choose this option up to four times.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Specialization (Ex)</strong>: The fighter selects one specific type of armor with which he is proficient, such as chain shirts or scale mail. While wearing the selected type of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, the fighter adds one-quarter of his fighter level to the armor’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor bonus</a>, up to a maximum bonus of +3 for light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, +4 for medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or +5 for heavy armor.

Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life itself.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d4.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The sorcerer’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong> (2 + Int modifier) x 4.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level: </strong>2 + Int modifier.</p>\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size: 13px; opacity: 0.8;\">Some description after&nbsp; Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. © 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.

He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below).</p>\n<p>To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer’s Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.</p>\n<p>A sorcerer’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can’t use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he’ll cast.</p>\n<p>Arcane spellcasters suffer from arcane spell failue due to armor - you can read more about it here <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"D35E.srd-rules\" data-id=\"lym8uzz7p1asi03K\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Arcane spells and armor</a></p>","spellcastingSpellname":"Spell","spellcastingSpellnamePl":"Spells","hasSpecialSlot":false,"spellPointGroup":"wizard","spellcastingAbility":"cha","spellslotAbility":"","spellPointBonusFormula":"0","spellPointTable":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0,"11":0,"12":0,"13":0,"14":0,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0},"powerPointBonusBaseAbility":"","powerPointTable":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0,"11":0,"12":0,"13":0,"14":0,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0},"powersKnown":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0,"11":0,"12":0,"13":0,"14":0,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0},"powersMaxLevel":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0,"11":0,"12":0,"13":0,"14":0,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0},"hd":4,"hp":0,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"allSpellsKnown":false,"halfCasterLevel":false,"creatureType":"humanoid","savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"apr":false,"acr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false,"blc":false,"coc":true,"dsc":false,"fog":false,"gif":false,"hid":false,"jmp":false,"lis":false,"mos":false,"opl":false,"src":false,"spt":false,"tmb":false,"uro":false,"kps":false,"aut":false,"psi":false,"upd":false},"nonActiveClassAbilities":[],"extraDescription":{"value":"<h2>Weapon and Armory Proficiency</h2>\n<p>Arcanists are proficient with all simple weapons.

She cannot combine these options—a spell prepared with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feats</a>&nbsp;cannot be further modified with another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feat</a>&nbsp;at the time of casting (unless she has the metamixing arcanist exploit, detailed below).</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

She can’t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/read-magic\">read magic</a>&nbsp;(which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>\n<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>/<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizards</a>‘&nbsp;or other arcanists’&nbsp;spellbooks to her own.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on&nbsp;Table: Arcanist Spells Prepared. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Reservoir (Su)</h2>\n<p>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist’s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist’s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist’s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>\n<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist’s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;by 1 or increase the spell’s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Exploits</h2>\n<p>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist’s level + the arcanist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>For a complete list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits\">Arcanist Exploits, see here</a></p>\n<h2>Consume Spells (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell.&nbsp;She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1).&nbsp;Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir’s maximum are lost.</p>\n<h2>Greater Exploits</h2>\n<p>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>\n<p>For a complete list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcanist-greater-exploits/\">Greater Exploits, see here</a></p>\n<h2>Magical Supremacy (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"kowljhpAAAuoOaJG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.D35E.classes.u0ULzrnt9daT9Ygq"}}}

This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;to grant half his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>.

He can dismiss this effect at any time as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours.

His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>\n<h2>Master Hunter (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, make a single attack against a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;at his full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">attack bonus</a>. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save or die.

In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors—they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world.

A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bloodline</h2>\n<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family’s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager’s alignment doesn’t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager/bloodrager-bloodlines/paizo-bloodrager-bloodlines/abyssal\">abyssal bloodline</a>, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager/bloodrager-bloodlines/paizo-bloodrager-bloodlines/infernal\">infernal bloodline</a>&nbsp;could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn’t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>\n<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like</a>&nbsp;bloodline powers, treat the character’s bloodrager level as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>.</p>\n<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on&nbsp;Table: Bloodrager. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>\n<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/Bloodrager/#TOC-Bloodline\">bloodline</a>&nbsp;to make them conform.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Mutations</strong>: Although heirs to similar arcane bloodlines may share commonalities, the unique circumstances in which a bloodline enters a bloodrager or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer’s</a>&nbsp;lineage can result in the manifestation of particularly strange or unusual bloodline powers known as mutations. Whenever a bloodrager or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;gains a new bloodline power, she can swap her bloodline power for a bloodline mutation whose prerequisites she meets. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager\">bloodrager</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;cannot swap a bloodline power that she has altered or replaced with an archetype for a bloodline mutation. A bloodrager need not be in a bloodrage to use her bloodline mutation powers. Alternatively, a bloodrager or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;can select a bloodline mutation in place of a bloodline bonus feat, provided her class level is at least equal to the level of the bloodline ability the mutation normally replaces.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer/bloodlines/bloodline-mutations\">The list of bloodline mutations can be found here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bloodrager Bloodlines</h2>\n<p>When a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, he often takes on a physical transformation influenced by his bloodline and powered by the magic that roils within him. Unless otherwise specified, he gains the effects of his bloodline powers only while in a bloodrage; once the bloodrage ends, all powers from his bloodline immediately cease, and any physical changes the bloodrager underwent revert, restoring him to normal.</p>\n<ul class=\"ogn-childpages\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.</p>\n<p>A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus\">morale bonus</a>&nbsp;to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>, as well as a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus\">morale bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves. In addition, he takes a –2 penalty to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">Armor Class</a>. The increase to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;grants the bloodrager 2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-\">Hit Die</a>, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\">temporary hit points</a>.

When the bloodrage ends, he’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigued</a>&nbsp;for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigued</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted\">exhausted</a>, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>\n<p>Bloodrage counts as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarian’s</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-\">rage</a>&nbsp;class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>\n<h2>Fast Movement (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A bloodrager’s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager’s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager’s land speed.</p>\n<h2>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>, nor does he lose his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if the attacker is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible\">invisible</a>. He still loses his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Feint\">feint</a>&nbsp;action against him.</p>\n<p>If a bloodrager already possesses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;from a different class, he automatically gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">improved uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;(see below) instead.</p>\n<h2>Blood Sanctuary (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>\n<h2>Blood Casting (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>\n<h2>Eschew Materials</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/eschew-materials\">Eschew Materials</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2>Spell Casting</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/bloodrager\">bloodrager spell list</a>. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Bloodrager. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score. The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn’t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.</p>\n<p>The bloodrager’s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Bloodrager Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline.&nbsp;At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;
