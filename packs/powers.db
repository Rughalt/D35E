In effect, the manifester has a 360-degree sphere of sight, allowing him or her perfect view of creatures that might otherwise flank the manifester. Thus, flanking opponents gain no bonus on their attack rolls instead of +2, and rogues are denied their sneak attack because the character does not lose his or her bonus to Dexterity (but they may still sneak attack if the character is caught flat-footed). The character's Spot checks gain a +3 enhancement bonus, and his or her Search checks gain a +1 enhancement bonus. Concurrently, the character suffers a 4 enhancement penalty on saves against all gaze attacks during the power's duration.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n","spellDuration":"2 rounds/level (D)\n","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"showInQuickbar":false,"attack":{"parts":[]},"snip":"You have all-around vision.","identifiedName":"Ubiquitous Vision","nameFormula":"","nameFromFormula":false,"uniqueId":"","source":"","classSource":"","userNonRemovable":false,"customAttributes":{},"customAttributesLocked":false,"autoscaleAttackParts":"","attackCountFormula":"","specialActions":[],"conditionals":[],"isSpellSpontaneousReplacement":false,"specialPrepared":false,"isDomainSpell":false,"specialId":null},"sort":600000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/powers/discipline/cla.png","effects":[]}

Your duplicate thinks and acts exactly as you do and follows your orders, although it will not do anything you wouldn’t do yourself. Your duplicate has all your abilities but none of your psionic or magical equipment (it does possess a duplicate of all your mundane equipment, clothing, armor, and implements, as well as mundane versions of any psionic or magical equipment you have). You and your duplicate evenly split your power points, your remaining usages of pertinent special abilities for the day, and so on. You retain your psionic focus, if you maintain such when this power is manifested. Treat your duplicate as yourself with two negative levels for the purpose of determining the powers to which the duplicate has access (while the duration of this power lasts, those negative levels cannot be removed by any means). Your duplicate has all other physical traits you had at the time you manifest this power. Powers, spells, or other effects affecting you when you manifest this power do not transfer to your duplicate.\n</p><p>When the duration expires or when you dismiss the power, you and your duplicate rejoin, no matter how far from each other you are. You gain back any power points the duplicate has not spent. At the time of rejoining, you take half of the damage your duplicate has taken since this power was manifested. This damage could potentially leave you with negative hit points, but it can’t reduce your hit points to less than –9.\n</p><p>If your duplicate dies before the duration expires, no rejoining occurs, and you gain one negative level. If you die, your duplicate remains in existence, and is for all intents you, but with two negative levels. (Once the duration expires, one of the negative levels immediately converts to one lost level; the other negative level can be removed by standard means.)\n</p><p>You can have only one <i>fissioned </i>duplicate in existence at one time; your duplicate cannot use this power. You cannot use <i>fusion </i>or <i>metaconcert </i>with a duplicate, or share any other power or effect that pools abilities (the sum of you and you is still just you). Similarly, attempting to use powers such as <i>claws of the vampire </i>or <i>vampiric blade </i>to hurt your duplicate only damages your duplicate; these powers do not heal you. <i>Empathic transfer </i>and similar powers are likewise ineffective (transferring wounds to yourself isn’t a good healing strategy).\n</p><p>All powers affecting a <i>fissioned </i>creature, either the original or the duplicate, end when the <i>fission </i>ends.

You and your duplicate evenly split your power points, your remaining usages of pertinent special abilities for the day, and so on. You retain your psionic focus, if you maintain such when this power is manifested. Treat your duplicate as yourself with two negative levels for the purpose of determining the powers to which the duplicate has access (while the duration of this power lasts, those negative levels cannot be removed by any means).

You gain back any power points the duplicate has not spent. At the time of rejoining, you take half of the damage your duplicate has taken since this power was manifested. This damage could potentially leave you with negative hit points, but it can’t reduce your hit points to less than –9.\n</p><p>If your duplicate dies before the duration expires, no rejoining occurs, and you gain one negative level.

A manifester can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per manifester level.\n</p><p>The manifester must succeed at attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using his or her base attack plus Intelligence modifier. Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds for hard, dense objects.\n</p><p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the power can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the power.
