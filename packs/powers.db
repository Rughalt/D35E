Studied carefully is a place known well, either because the manifester has been there often or has used other means to study the place. Seen casually is a place that the manifester has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. Viewed once is a place that the manifester has seen once, possibly using psionics. Description is a place whose location and appearance are know through someone else's description, perhaps even from a precise map.\n</p><p>False destination is a place that doesn't exist. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for the manifester to arrive at or even be off target from.\n</p><p>On Target: The manifester appears where he or she wants to be.\n</p><p>Off Target: The manifester appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled.\n</p><p>Similar Area: The manifester winds up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, the manifester appears in the closest similar place, but since the power has no range limit, he or she could conceivably wind up somewhere else across the globe.\n</p><p>Mishap: The manifester and anyone else teleporting with him or her have gotten scrambled. Each character suffers 1d10 points of damage, and reroll on the chart to see where the characters wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time Mishap comes up, the characters suffer more damage and must reroll.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n","spellDuration":"Instantaneous\n","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"showInQuickbar":false,"attack":{"parts":[]},"nameFormula":"","nameFromFormula":false,"uniqueId":"","source":"","classSource":"","userNonRemovable":false,"customAttributes":{},"customAttributesLocked":false,"autoscaleAttackParts":"","attackCountFormula":"","specialActions":[],"conditionals":[],"isSpellSpontaneousReplacement":false,"snip":"","specialPrepared":false,"isDomainSpell":false,"specialId":null},"sort":600000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/powers/discipline/por.png","effects":[]}

Negate psionics cannot undo the effects of any power with instantaneous duration.\n</p><p>The manifester chooses to use negate psionics in one of two ways: a targeted negation or an area negation:\n</p><p>Targeted Negation: One object, creature, or power is the target of the power. The manifester makes a negation check against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. A negation check is 1d20 + 1 per manifester level (maximum +10) against a DC of 11 + the power-to-be-negated's manifester level.\n</p><p>If the object targeted is a psionic item, make a negation check against the item's manifester level. If successful, all the item's psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect.\n</p><p>A character automatically succeedes in the negation check against any power that character manifest him or herself.\n</p><p>Area Negation: The power affects everything within a 30-foot radius.\n</p><p>For each creature that is the target of one or more powers, make a negation check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that fails, make negation checks against progressively weaker powers until one power is negated (which discharges the negate psionics so far as that target is concerned) or all checks fail. The creature's psionic items are not affected.\n</p><p>For each object that is the target of one or more powers, make negation checks as with creatures. Psionic items are not affected by area negations.\n</p><p>For each ongoing power with an area centered within the negate psionics target area, make a negation check to negate the power.\n</p><p>For each ongoing power whose area overlaps with that of the negation, make a negation check to end the effect, but only within the area of the negate psionics.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n\n","spellDuration":"Instantaneous\n","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"showInQuickbar":false,"attack":{"parts":[]},"nameFormula":"","nameFromFormula":false,"uniqueId":"","source":"","classSource":"","userNonRemovable":false,"customAttributes":{},"customAttributesLocked":false,"autoscaleAttackParts":"","attackCountFormula":"","specialActions":[],"conditionals":[],"isSpellSpontaneousReplacement":false,"snip":"","specialPrepared":false,"isDomainSpell":false,"specialId":null},"sort":600000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/powers/discipline/kin.png","effects":[]}
